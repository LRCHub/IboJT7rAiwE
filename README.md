# Charli Morgan – Pepper Spray and Acid Rain

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Full-metal chain gun
Onion rings and rocket pods
Armor-piercing pussy-slayer
Gotta whip the tail, Player

Do I sound like banshee dreams?
Missile streaks and laser beams
Bitch seat in the steel beast
Pilot king between my knees

Pepper spray and candy rain
War drums pound in sugar cane
Bullet kisses, acid rain
Dip my feet in Novocain

Armor glints, suppressing fire
Pilot touch, make me come higher

I know you like it when I call you up
And you drop down and let me make some love
For what I need is just between the two of us
'Cause you know that I'll fuck you, right?

Beckon forth, I'm just as sweet
No one's safe when my heart beats
Copper, nickel, cadmium
Punch my guts like valium

JP-8 and burning eyes
Neon glow, I tell no lies
Rocket thrust, my begging cries
Fucking you's how girls die

Choppers dance, my lovers ride
Pierce my armor, deep inside
Explosive, pungent, no remorse
Pilot ride me like a horse

Sharpened blades of poison lust
In this madness, we both trust

I know you like it when I call you up
And you drop down and let me make some love
For what I need is just between the two of us
'Cause you know that I'll fuck you, right?

Armor-piercing, love and war
Tandem rockets, hardened core
Bird or butter, come in gutters
Ask me how I like my utters

Battle cries, my panties wet
Smoke trailing the red sunset
Raging fire, raging fist
That's the place the lord forbids

Cherry pussy, hot war crimes
Losing fingers, arming mines
Pilots hands, I'm out of time
Fuck me Peli, its a sign

Seven-ten scent, my senses burn
In your arms, I twist and turn

I know you like it when I call you up
And you drop down and let me make some love
For what I need is just between the two of us
'Cause you know that I'll fuck you, right?

Hell is love in combat zones
Screaming skies and flesh and bone
Take me hard with wild swings
Pin me on, those bloody wings

Napalm kisses, twisted phase
War crimes written on your face
Peli-kun, don't make me wait
Can you guess what I ate yesterday?

I know you like it when I call you up
And you drop down and let me make some love
For what I need is just between the two of us
'Cause you know that I'll fuck you, right?
